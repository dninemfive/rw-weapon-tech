# Weapon Tech
*"Weapon Tech replaces and expands the vanilla weapon research, with a larger emphasis on chronological progression. This means starting with smoothbore muzzle-loaders, and finishing with state-of-the-art gauss weapons. Also featured are composite vests, mannable turrets, and bonus weapons; guns that can only be bought or scavenged, much like the Megascreen Television and Telescope."*

A weapon mod for Rimworld, originally by Janson, adding a number of weapons, only some of which are craftable - others must be found on enemies or through quest rewards. It also reworks the weapon research tree, adding additional tiers of progression. More info can be found on the wiki (tbd) and a balancing spreadsheet may be made available in the future.
